      <description>Following the LXD theme of my previous posts, today I’m going to walk you through creating a RHEL 9 VM on LXD, and then show you how to turn that VM into an image. This way, you can spin up new RHEL 9 VMs whenever you want—without having to sit through the whole install/setup process again.
To follow along, you’ll need an active Red Hat subscription. If you’re doing this for personal use (like self-development, home lab tinkering, or just because you enjoy virtual machines as much as Netflix), you can download RHEL for free when you sign up for the Red Hat Developer Subscription for Individuals.</description>

      <description>Last week, I attended a virtual talk hosted by Canonical on building a homelab with microservices. During the session, I discovered a new (to me) and very cool utility that&amp;rsquo;s perfect for managing virtual machines and containers from a centralized interface: LXD, or the Linux Container Daemon.
While LXD isn&amp;rsquo;t new—it’s actually been around since 2016—it’s still flying under the radar for a lot of homelab enthusiasts. After seeing it in action, I realized it&amp;rsquo;s a hidden gem worth exploring.</description>
