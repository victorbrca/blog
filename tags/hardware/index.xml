      <description>On this tutorial I will show you how to install and configure TLP and Intel P-state and CPUFreq Manager on your ThinkPad P1 Gen 2 (with KDE Arch).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, TLP allows you to configure specific rules to help optimize the battery life on your laptop, while Intel P-state and CPUFreq Manager gives you a pretty interface via a tray icon that allows you to control CPU/GPU frequencies and a few power profiles.</description>

      <description>The XPS 13 is a great laptop and it comes with an equally matched touchpad. Setting up touch gestures is pretty easy, and we will cover what needs to be done to get it working on Arch.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s install all the needed software:
 extra/libinput aur/libinput-gestures  After installing the 2 packages you should be able to run libinput-gestures -d as root and try the pre-defined gestures. You should see an output when you swipe left/right/up/down with &amp;frac34; fingers and pinch in/out.</description>

      <description>Simple instructions (assuming a new Raspbian install) to install Kuman 3.5 TFT LCD on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
a. Download Rasbian strech (with desktop) and extract the .img file from the downloaded zip (it&amp;rsquo;s always good to also check the hash of the downloaded file)
b. Insert the SD card and make note of the device being used (make sure you get this right not to overwrite your OS)</description>

      <description>After commuting close to 1000kms a week for 6 years, I have decided to the the leap and move to Toronto. After all, I was here around 4 nights a week, and having to commute back and forward between Mississauga and Toronto had become a hassle. This would also increase my work drive (from 85kms each way to 115kms), but luckily my client agreed for me to work remote 4 days of the week, with made my move even more possible.</description>

      <title>Gnome Touchpad Settings Missing in Arch Xps 13</title>

      <description>I had an issue where the Gnome extension &amp;lsquo;Touchpad Indicator&amp;rsquo; stopped working on my xps 13 (Arch). After looking a bit further, it seems that the Gnome Touchpad settings had also stopped working. All I could see was the mouse settings, and the touchpad section was completelly gone.
Solution:
With Gnome 3.20, xf86-input-synaptics is not longer supported, and you should use xf86-input-libinput instead.
You can check what is installed on your Arch system with pacman -Q | grep input.</description>
