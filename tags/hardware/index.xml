      <description>After commuting close to 1000kms a week for 6 years, I have decided to the the leap and move to Toronto. After all, I was here around 4 nights a week, and having to commute back and forward between Mississauga and Toronto had become a hassle. This would also increas my work drive (from 85kms each way to 115kms), but luckily my client agreed for me to work remote 4 days of the week, with made my move even more possible.</description>

      <description>I had an issue where the Gnome extension &amp;lsquo;Touchpad Indicator&amp;rsquo; stopped working on my xps 13 (Arch). After looking a bit further, it seems that the Gnome Touchpad settings had also stopped working. All I could see was the mouse settings, and the touchpad section was completelly gone.
Solution:
With Gnome 3.20, xf86-input-synaptics is not longer supported, and you should use xf86-input-libinput instead.
You can check what is installed on your Arch system with pacman -Q | grep input.</description>
