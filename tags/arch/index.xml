      <description>Chrome Remote Desktop has been around for quite a while, but now Google offers a .deb installer with native Linux support via Systemd. This is great because it removes the need to setup VPNs and VNC to remote connect to your machines, or in the case that you need to land a hand to a not so technical savvy family member or friend.
Unfortunately the installer is only for Ubuntu (and Debian based distros), but with a few steps we can get it running on Arch, and (thanks to a patch by nightuser) even configure it to use existing X sessions instead of creating a new one (which is the default behavior).</description>

      <title>Gnome Touchpad Settings Missing in Arch Xps 13</title>

      <description>I had an issue where the Gnome extension &amp;lsquo;Touchpad Indicator&amp;rsquo; stopped working on my xps 13 (Arch). After looking a bit further, it seems that the Gnome Touchpad settings had also stopped working. All I could see was the mouse settings, and the touchpad section was completelly gone.
Solution:
With Gnome 3.20, xf86-input-synaptics is not longer supported, and you should use xf86-input-libinput instead.
You can check what is installed on your Arch system with pacman -Q | grep input.</description>
