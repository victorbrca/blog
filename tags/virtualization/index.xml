      <description>Following the LXD theme of my previous posts, today Iâ€™m going to walk you through creating a RHEL 9 VM on LXD, and then show you how to turn that VM into an image. This way, you can spin up new RHEL 9 VMs whenever you wantâ€”without having to sit through the whole install/setup process again.
To follow along, youâ€™ll need an active Red Hat subscription. If youâ€™re doing this for personal use (like self-development, home lab tinkering, or just because you enjoy virtual machines as much as Netflix), you can download RHEL for free when you sign up for the Red Hat Developer Subscription for Individuals.</description>

      <description>Yes, you can run Windows 10 or 11 inside LXD. Itâ€™s actually not that hardâ€”just a few prep steps and some command-line magic. These instructions are written for Arch, but the process is nearly the same on other distros (package names may change a bit).
Letâ€™s go.
Step 1: Preparing the Image a. Grab the ISO:
Download Windows from Microsoft like a law-abiding citizen: ðŸ‘‰ https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download
b. Install the required packages</description>

      <description>Last week, I attended a virtual talk hosted by Canonical on building a homelab with microservices. During the session, I discovered a new (to me) and very cool utility that&amp;rsquo;s perfect for managing virtual machines and containers from a centralized interface: LXD, or the Linux Container Daemon.
While LXD isn&amp;rsquo;t newâ€”itâ€™s actually been around since 2016â€”itâ€™s still flying under the radar for a lot of homelab enthusiasts. After seeing it in action, I realized it&amp;rsquo;s a hidden gem worth exploring.</description>
