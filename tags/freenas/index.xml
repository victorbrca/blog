      <description>After having bad memory modules due to power outages at home (on both my FreeNAS and my desktop) I knew I had to invest on a UPS. I will cover the details of the configuration, and as usual, I will try to go straight to the point.
Keep in mind that I&amp;rsquo;m running Arch on my desktop and FreeNAS-11.3-U1, and that the UPS is connected to my desktop (master) via USB.</description>

I had read the manual (FreeNAS® 11.3-U1 User Guide) before the upgrade and and the instructions did not mention anything about the plugins, so I was little worried.</description>
