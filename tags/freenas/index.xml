      <description>Quick and simple instructions on how to install Telegraf collector agent on FreeNAS.
a. Start by creating a folder for Telegraf on one of your pools. I have mine under /mnt/Volume1/home/system/telegraf
b. Download the Telegraf tar for FreeBSD (here), extract it and copy the binary and the .conf files to the folder we created in the previous step
 ./telegraf-[version]/usr/bin/telegraf ./telegraf-[version]/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf  c. Create telegraf.init in the same folder (make sure to modify the 2 lines with your path)</description>

      <description>After having bad memory modules due to power outages at home (on both my FreeNAS and my desktop) I knew I had to invest on a UPS. I will cover the details of the configuration, and as usual, I will try to go straight to the point.
Keep in mind that I&amp;rsquo;m running Arch on my desktop and FreeNAS-11.3-U1, and that the UPS is connected to my desktop (master) via USB.</description>

      <description>I had some free time this weekend and decided to upgrade my FreeNAS. I went from 11.1 to 11.3-UI and the upgrade installed without any issues. However, after the reboot I discovered that my jails and plugins were missing from the UI and that they were not running. I had read the manual (FreeNAS® 11.3-U1 User Guide) before the upgrade and and the instructions did not mention anything about the plugins, so I was little worried.</description>
