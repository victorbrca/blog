      <description>After commuting close to 1000kms a week for 6 years, I have decided to the the leap and move to Toronto. After all, I was here around 4 nights a week, and having to commute back and forward between Mississauga and Toronto had become a hassle. This would also increas my work drive (from 85kms each way to 115kms), but luckily my client agreed for me to work remote 4 days of the week, with made my move even more possible.</description>
