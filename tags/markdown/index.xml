      <description>I have been looking for a good Markdown editor for quite a while, and after a lot of research, I finally I found one.
Some of the key features that were very important to me on a Markdown editor were:
 Live preview File browser (sidebar) GitHub flavored Fast and non laggy preview  And not surprisingly, Atom from GitHub was my solution.
You might also want to:
 Change the preferences of the already installed package markdown-preview to GitHub flavored   And install markdown-preview-auto-open  apm install markdown-preview-auto-open  </description>
