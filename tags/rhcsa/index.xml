      <description>Disclaimer These are my study notes for the RHCSA exam on disk compression. There&amp;rsquo;s most likely more information than what&amp;rsquo;s needed for the exam, and I cannot guarantee that all information is correct.

Definition Virtual Data Optimizer (VDO) provides inline data reduction for Linux in the form of deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning. When you set up a VDO volume, you specify a block device on which to construct your VDO volume and the amount of logical storage you plan to present.</description>

      <description>The updated RHCSA exam for RHEL 8 has been out since last year, however, the old exam is still available, and will stay available until August 1st, 2020:
You may be trying to figure out what version will be best for you, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the information here will help you.
Something to take in consideration is that the exam is valid for 3 years, or 2 releases (meaning that once RHEL 9 is out, your RHSCA on RHEL 7 is no longer valid).</description>
